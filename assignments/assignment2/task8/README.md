### Task 8: Create a new array with all the even elements of both of the given arrays

Assume, you have been given two arrays. [Your program should work for any two given arrays; change the following arrays and check whether your program works correctly for the code you have written]

- array_one = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
- array_two = [10, 11, 12, -13, -14, -15, -16]

Write a Cpp program that creates a new array with all the even elements of both of the given arrays and prints the new array.

### Hint: You may create a third array to store the even elements of the given arrays.

- Output for the above arrays: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, -14, -16]
