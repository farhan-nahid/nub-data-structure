### Task 1

Write a Cpp program that reads 5 numbers from the user into a array. After reading each number, print all the numbers that have been entered so far in the array.

### Example:

- If the user enters 3, prints “Numbers in the array: [3]”
- If the user enters 5 next, prints “Numbers in the array: [3, 5]”
- If the user enters 34, prints “Numbers in the array: [3, 5, 34]”
- If the user then enters -11, prints “Numbers in the array: [3, 5, 34, -11]”
- Finally, if the user enters 0 as the last number, prints “Numbers in the array: [3, 5, 34, -11, 0]”
